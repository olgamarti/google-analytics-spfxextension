## Debug

To debug the extension in your SharePoint Site run

```
gulp serve --nobrowser
```

Copy the generated querystring in the terminal after the build, and change prop1 for gtag and val1 for your Google Analytics Tag.

```
GAnalyticsApplicationCustomizer:
?loadSPFX=true&debugManifestsFile=https://localhost:4321/temp/manifests.js&customActions={"79f80
0a6-9286-4965-891c-00017b35cd8d":{"location":"ClientSideExtension.ApplicationCustomizer","proper
ties":{"gtag":"UA-XXXXXXX-1"}}}
```

Paste it after your SharePoint Site URL.

Visit your Google Analytics portal and go to Real Time to check if the configuration is working correctly. 

The data of the custom dimension in our custom report may take time to appear (24h).
